# Chat App

A cross-platform mobile chat application built with **React Native** and **Expo**, leveraging **Google Firestore Database** and **Firebase Cloud Storage**. This app enables users to communicate, share images, and send their location in real-time, optimized for both Android and iOS devices.

## üì± Project Brief

### Objective
To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

### Context
With the increasing reliance on mobile devices for daily tasks, companies often develop native mobile apps for better user experience. Traditionally, building apps for multiple platforms (iOS & Android) required separate codebases and specialized developers. **React Native** solves this by allowing a single codebase for both platforms. This project utilizes React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore to create a robust chat application, demonstrating JavaScript mobile development skills.
