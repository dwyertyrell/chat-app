## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- An Android or iOS device/emulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwyertyrell/chat-app.git
   cd chat-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project and enable Firestore, Authentication (Anonymous), and Cloud Storage.
   - Copy your Firebase config to the project (usually in `config.js` or directly in your main app file).

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

5. **Run the app:**
   - On a physical device: Scan the QR code using Expo Go.
   - On an emulator: Press `a` for Android or `i` for iOS in the terminal.

## Setting Up the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in your local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (recommended: latest LTS version)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (will be installed via `npx`)
- A physical Android or iOS device, or an emulator
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go) app installed on your mobile device (available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779))
- A Firebase project (for database, authentication, and storage setup)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwyertyrell/chat-app.git
   cd chat-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firestore Database, Cloud Storage, and Authentication (set to Anonymous sign-in).
   - Copy your Firebase configuration into the project (usually in a `config.js` file or directly in your main app file).

4. **Start the Expo development server:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Run the app on your mobile device:**
   - Open the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go) app on your phone.
   - Scan the QR code shown in your terminal or browser after running `npx expo start`.
   - The app will load and run natively on your device.

   > **Tip:** You can also press `a` to launch the app on an Android emulator or `i` for an iOS simulator if set up on your computer.

### Troubleshooting

- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network for Expo Go to connect.
- If you encounter issues scanning the QR code, you can manually enter the Expo URL provided in the terminal into Expo Go.
- Check your Firebase configuration and permissions if you encounter authentication or database errors.
